# Common data issues

## Placeholder values

You don't generally need to use these. Very few fields are mandatory, and so you can leave a field empty if necessary.

## Illegal XIDX values

Some values are not permitted for AIDX/RIDX/CIDX. Currently these are

* CR0
* default

## Unpublished data

You can send us it as a dataset and we'll assign a DOI If it's accepted, then send us the journal details and we'll assign a DOI.&#x20;

If you do have a DOI but it's not actually published, then send us all the details.&#x20;

If you need a reviewer to be able to see the data during review, then contact us and we can discuss hosting.
