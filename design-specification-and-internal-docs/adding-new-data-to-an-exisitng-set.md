# Adding new data to an exisitng set

* If an update to a source updates the previously loaded ACTIVITY file, existing activities will need to be wiped before loading these supplementary files. 
* To delete activities for a source, use [util 17 here](https://app.gitbook.com/@chembl/s/chembl-loader/design-specification-and-internal-docs/list-of-loader-utiities). This can take a file list of AIDXs or a command line list of job IDs to delete the activities for.
