# How the loader works

You can see a description of how to run under different modes [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@chembl/s/chembl-loader/design-specification-and-internal-docs/running-loader#loading-modes-m-option).

### Modes 1-3

These check the data are suitable, and show what would be loaded if mode 4 was run on the input files. They do not make any changes to the database, and are good for validating the input files. 

### Mode 4

This actually loads the data. The loader will load to the DEP tables and the visible tables \(e.g. DEP\_ASSAY and ASSAY\) independently.

### Validating the files

The loader will check that the files in the directory match the regex patterns for valid files. It will expect to see the files named in  "[Input file structure and requirements](https://app.gitbook.com/@chembl/s/chembl-loader/~/drafts/-MkHBKwUYgvdHAMnL3Oh/untitled-10)". It will skip over temporary and log files that were generated by previous runs of the loader. It will also skip over README files, as well as the .DS\_STORE files that mark Mac directories. 

### Validating the headers

The loader will check the the headers for a file match the names described in the`input_files` dict in ldconfigs.py. If the headers names are illegal, or a mandatory header is missing, the loader will exit.

### Validating the data

The data are read in from the file to the dataframes described in  "\# HEADERS..." section of ldConfigs. A lot of the variables used here are drawn from globalvars.py. Depending on the column, a failure to match a dependency or pattern could be a low-priority warning, or it could force the loader to exit.

### Configuration Overview

You can see full notes on how the loader is configured on the [loader configuration](https://app.gitbook.com/@chembl/s/chembl-loader/~/drafts/-MkD4-12NsOgEWuDeeE4/design-specification-and-internal-docs/loader-configuration) page.

**globalVars.py**

* globalVars.py has dependency \(gdXX\) and pattern \(gpXX\) functions that check if a field is valid.
  * Dependency functions check the contents of another column. E.g. "If a Title exists, there must also be a Year"
  * Pattern functions check the contents of a target column. E.g. "If there is a PubMed ID, it must match this regex for an expected PubMed ID".
* globalVars.py also defines filenames, headers and table names, which get referenced in ldConfigs.py
