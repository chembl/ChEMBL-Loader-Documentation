# How the loader works

You can see a description of how to run under different modes [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@chembl/s/chembl-loader/design-specification-and-internal-docs/running-loader#loading-modes-m-option).

### Modes 1-3

These check the data is suitable and show what would be loaded

### Mode 4

This actually loads the data. The loader will load to the DEP tables and the visible tables \(e.g. DEP\_ASSAY and ASSAY\) independently.

### Validating the headers

### Validating the data

### Configuration

You can see notes on how the loader is configured on the [loader configuration](https://app.gitbook.com/@chembl/s/chembl-loader/~/drafts/-MkD4-12NsOgEWuDeeE4/design-specification-and-internal-docs/loader-configuration) page.
